**Rishi Ghan's personal website**

This repository holds the files for my personal website.

1. It is built on the Ruby on Rails framework.

2. It has a very lightweight, custom CMS with a focus on publishing
content quickly and without fuss.

3. It has some interesting additions such as sparkline graphs to denote pageviews for each post.

I wish to maintain this website actively and keep building on it.
